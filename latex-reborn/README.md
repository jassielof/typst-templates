# LaTeX Reborn

LaTeX Reborn is a port and adaptation of the standard LaTeX document classes to Typst.

The following document classes are available:

- Article
- Report
- Book
- Letter

Each class can be imported with its namespace.

## Usage and examples

For usage and examples, please initialize a new Typst document based on this template to get started.

## Considerations on design choices

I've tried to port exactly the same design choices as in the original classes, but following perfectly the same measurements, for example, aren't ported equally in Typst, that's why the template may or not have the exact measurements in some parts.

Therefore, don't expect an exact pixel-perfect output compared to LaTeX, but mostly a close one.
