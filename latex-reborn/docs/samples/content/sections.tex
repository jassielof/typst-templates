\paragraph[Long paragraph (short TOC)]{A Very Long Paragraph Heading That Demonstrates How Run-In Headings Wrap When the Title Itself Exceeds the Line Width and Continues Onto the Next Line} This text immediately follows the long run-in heading to make the wrapping effect obvious. Subsequent sentences illustrate paragraph flow after a long heading.

\subparagraph[Long subparagraph (short TOC)]{A Very Long Subparagraph Heading to Show Even Deeper Levels With Lots of Words and Punctuation, Causing Line Wraps as Needed} More run-in text after a long subparagraph heading. This helps visualize spacing and punctuation handling.
